    "When running JupyterLab (Python) locally, the files only get stored in the \"uploads\" folder and are not sent to the outside runtime. In JupyterLite (Pyodide) environment, the files are sent to the outside runtime and stored in the \"uploads\" folder.\n",

    "### 3.2. Specific Considerations\n",
    "#### 3.2.1. Interface creation\n",
    "\n",
    "The following conventions are used in the interface creation examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We assume that two input materials are either in bulk form (e.g. Ni crystal) or layered (e.g. graphene). \n",
    "1. We construct the interface along the Z-axis. The material corresponding to the bottom of the interface is referred to as the \"**substrate**\", and the top - as the \"**film**\". \n"

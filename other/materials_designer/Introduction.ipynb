    "This Jupyter Lite distribution contains pre-configured examples of materials transformations including simple ones like creation of supercell or a surface, and more complex like creating an interface with Zur and McGill Superlattice matching algorithm\n",

    "\n",
    "[This file](interface_creation/zsl_interface_generation.ipynb) helps creating interface between two materials by finding matching superlattices and selecting optimal variants by size-strain trade-off. (Link to the lattice match algorithm: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.333084)\n",

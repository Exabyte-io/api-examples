# # Predicting Perovskite Volumes
# 
# This dataset comes from a perovskite database hosted by the NOMAD lab (https://nomad-lab.eu/). In this notebook, we'll featurize a set of crystal cells automatically using XenonPy, and we'll create a model to predict the volume automatically using TPOT.
# 
# Let's start off by installing nomad-lab from pip. We'll also need to install TPOT and XenonPy

# In[]:


get_ipython().system('pip install nomad-lab tpot xenonpy')


# # Import Packages
# We'll import some standard Python ML packages.
# 
# In addition, we'll import a couple of others:
# - XenonPy (https://xenonpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a materials science toolkit similar to RDKit, generating features for materials inputs
# - TPOT (http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/) is an AutoML tool. Using a genetic algorithm, it acts as a computerized data-scientist, automatically testing and selecting a model for a dataset.
# - Nomad API (https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/rae/docs/index.html) allows access to NOMAD's large database of DFT calculations
# 
# We'll also specify a random seed, for reproducibility.

# # Query NOMAD
# 
# We'll first query NOMAD for a database named "stable inorganic perovskites," which has 144 materials inside of it.
# 
# Then, we'll convert each feature to an ASE atoms object, for use in featurization down the road.

# # Feature Engineering
# 
# Next, we'll featurize our dataset using XenonPy. In a real-world scenario, this is where we should be spending much of our time. Good features lead to good models.
# 
# In this case, we're going to just use XenonPy to generate 290 features per entry. In a nutshell, it takes in the composition of each formula unit, and then looks up many descriptors (such as ionization energies).
# Then, it derives various properties, such as the minimum, maximum, average, etc. For example, the average

# # Correlation Chart
# 
# Below we find a correlation chart, giving a high-level overview of some of the correlations found in the ata. Because there are so many features, it's difficult to determine the individual correlations. That said, what we can see is that we're in a highly-correlated feature space - this can easily be observed by noting the relatively large area consisting of bright yellow and dark blue colors in the plot.

# # Train/Test Split
# 
# Next, we'll do a train/test split of the dataset. We don't have a lot of data, but we'll try a 50/50 train/test split. We're using a lot of features together with a highly flexible model (TPOT can choose between many different models and many different hyperparameters), so we want it to be very apparent if we're at all overfitting.

# In[]:


# Train/Test Split
train, test = sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(data, test_size=0.5, random_state=RANDOM_SEED)

x_cols = data.drop(columns=["Volume"]).columns
y = train.Volume.to_numpy()
x = train[x_cols].to_numpy()


# # TPOT Regression
# 
# Next, we'll use TPOT, a genetic algorithm that automatically selects models and their hyperparameters. We'll use the following settings:
# - `generations = None`, to place no limit on the number of possible generations
# - `population_size = 20`, a small population size for exploratory purposes
# - `max_eval_time_mins = 100/60/1000`, again a short evaluation time of 10ms, just for exploring this technique on a laptop
# - `cv=len(x)`, to use leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). It generally performs well on small datasets like ours, compared to 5/10-fold CV
# - `scoring` is set to the negative root mean squared error of the model, which will give us the (negative) error of the model we might expect, in Ã…^3
# - `n_jobs=-1`, to use as many jobs as there are cores on the machine
# 
# Finally, we'll set `max_time_mins` to 2, to run the pipeline for a grand total of 2 minutes.

# In[]:


model = tpot.TPOTRegressor(
    generations=None,
    population_size=100,
    max_eval_time_mins = 100/60/1000,
    max_time_mins=5,
    cv=len(x), # LOOCV
    verbosity=2,
    scoring="neg_root_mean_squared_error",
    config_dict=tpot.config.regressor_config_dict,
    n_jobs=-1,
    random_state=RANDOM_SEED
)
model.fit(x, y)


# # Training is Done!
# 
# Now, we'll print the best pipeline that was found. At the time this notebook was created (we used a random seed of 42 for the train/test split and the pipeline, so this should be reproducible), we find the following steps:
# - Feature selection based on the Family-Wise Error rate. Specifically, Sklearn's implementation uses the [Bonferroni Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction). Given a significance alpha, a feature is kept if its p-value (w.r.t. the target varible) is below alpha divided by the number of samples in the training set. In this case, alpha is chosen to be 0.02.
# - Scaling each feature to be between 0 and 1, a fairly standard choice in ML work
# - Linear Support Vector Regression
# 
# Overall, this is a very reasonable result for this type of regression problem, one that a human would believably choose to evaluate when looking at different potential models. We see the elements of a basic ML pipeline here: feature selection, followed by some scaling of the data, followed by a model.
# 
# Moreover, the pipeline considers a fairly conservative feature selection approach, with a more-stringengent signifiance than normal (a=0.02 versus a=0.05), which will help in this situation, where we have many different features compared to the number of training samples.
# 
# The chosen model is also reasonable in this case, as the L2 loss function will help with the highly-dimensional space that we're fitting.

# In[]:


print("Best Pipeline")
print(model.fitted_pipeline_)

selected_features = data.drop(columns="Volume").columns[model.fitted_pipeline_[0].get_support()]

print(f"Model selected {len(selected_features)} features")
print(selected_features)


# # Draw a Parity Plot
# 
# Finally, we'll evaluate our model against the test set. Recall that we left out 50% of our testing set, because we want some extra insurance (beyond the LOOCV used during training) against overfitting. We can see in the below plot that in general, we do pretty well.
# 
# In fact, our test-set mean-absolute-percentage-error is 3.9%. This means that on average, we're off by 3.9% with respect to the testing set.

# In[]:


# Print some model statistics
train_preds = model.predict(x)
test_preds = model.predict(test[x_cols].to_numpy())
test_mape = sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_true=test.Volume, y_pred=test_preds)
print(f"Test MAPE = {test_mape}")

# Parity Plot
plt.scatter(train_preds, y, label="Training Set")
plt.scatter(test_preds, test.Volume, label="Test Set")

# Ensure plot is square

        max(max(y), max(test.Volume.to_numpy()))]

# # Make a Prediction!
# 
# Generally, we train models to do predictions later. To test this out, we'll investigate Samarium Nickle Oxide. According to Materials Project ( https://materialsproject.org/materials/mp-22495/# ), this material has a volume of 226.362 Ã…^3. Normalized by the number of formula units, the volume is 60.105 Ã…^3 per formula unit.
# 
# We find that our volume is predicted to be 59.59 Ã…^3 per formula unit.

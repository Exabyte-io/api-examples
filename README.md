### `notebooks_utils` — Python Utility Package

`src/py/mat3ra/notebooks_utils` is the shared Python library used by all notebooks. It is organised in four layers:

```
primitive/  →  core/  →  ipython/  →  pyodide/
```

| Layer | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `primitive` | `notebooks_utils/primitive/` | Pure stdlib: enums, environment detection, logger, CLI helpers. No third-party dependencies. |
| `core` | `notebooks_utils/core/` | Third-party packages (`mat3ra.api_client`, `requests`, `numpy`, …). No IPython or browser APIs. Organised by domain under `core/entity/<domain>/` with separate `api.py`, `io.py`, and `analysis.py` files. |
| `ipython` | `notebooks_utils/ipython/` | IPython/ipywidgets display helpers, HTML/JS output, and domain-specific plots. Works in JupyterLab, Colab, and VS Code notebooks. |
| `pyodide` | `notebooks_utils/pyodide/` | JupyterLite-specific overrides: `micropip` installation, `pyfetch` HTTP, `BroadcastChannel` data bridge, and WASM/Emscripten APIs. |

Top-level files (`auth.py`, `io.py`, `ui.py`, `plot.py`, `settings.py`, `material.py`, `job.py`) are thin routing adapters that keep notebook code environment-agnostic.

See [`src/py/mat3ra/notebooks_utils/README.md`](src/py/mat3ra/notebooks_utils/README.md) for the full developer guide.



## Setup

NOTE: this package targets **Python 3.10 or newer** (`requires-python` in `pyproject.toml`). Use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) to manage Python versions.

Follow the steps below in order to setup and view the Jupyter notebooks:

0. [Install git-lfs](https://help.github.com/articles/installing-git-large-file-storage/) [[3](#links)] in order to get access to the source code and notebook files.

1. Clone repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Exabyte-io/api-examples.git
    ```

    Or, if you have set up SSH keys

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Exabyte-io/api-examples.git
    ```

    In case for some reason git-lfs was not installed at the time of cloning, the files can be pulled after installing git-lfs, through `git lfs pull`.

    Related to this, please be aware that as the `.ipynb` and `.poscar` files are stored on git-lfs, they are not part of the zip archive downloaded through GitHub's web interface.

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    cd api-examples
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the package with the extras that match what you want to run:

    | Use case | Install command |
    |----------|-----------------|
    | API examples (`examples/`) | `pip install -e ".[api,jupyterlab]"` |
    | Materials Designer notebooks (`other/materials_designer/`) | `pip install -e ".[materials,jupyterlab]"` |
    | Workflow notebooks (`other/materials_designer/workflows/`) | `pip install -e ".[workflows,jupyterlab]"` |
    | Everything | `pip install -e ".[all,jupyterlab]"` |
    | Development (linting, tests) | `pip install -e ".[all_dev,jupyterlab]"` |

4. Run Jupyter and open a notebook in a browser. In order for the post-save hook feature to work properly, one must launch their Jupyter Notebook environment in the folder that contains the file `config.py`, which is the `examples` folder shown below:

    ```bash
    cd examples
    jupyter lab --config=config.py
    ```

## Usage

In order to run or edit the examples:

1. Assert an existing Mat3ra.com account. Examples require an account to run. New users can register [here](https://platform.mat3ra.com/register) to obtain one.

2. Open the desired example notebook and run all cells. Authentication uses OIDC device flow via `await authenticate()` — a browser popup opens for login. On JupyterLite (platform-embedded notebooks), credentials are injected automatically.

3. Optionally, for local Jupyter without OIDC, set legacy API token values in [settings.json](src/py/mat3ra/notebooks_utils/core/api/settings.json). See [Get Authentication Params](examples/system/get_authentication_params.ipynb) for details. API tokens can also be generated in [Account Preferences](https://docs.mat3ra.com/accounts/ui/preferences/api/) on the platform.

NOTE: The Materials Project API key should be set in `settings.json` and obtained from [https://legacy.materialsproject.org/open](https://legacy.materialsproject.org/open).


## Contribute

This is an open-source repository and we welcome contributions for other use cases. The original set of examples is only meant to demonstrate the capabilities and can be extended.

We suggest forking this repository and introducing the adjustments there. The changes in the fork can further be considered for merging into this repository as it is commonly used on GitHub. This process is explained in more details elsewhere online [[4](#links)].

If you would like to add new examples or adjust existing ones, please consider the following:

1. Put examples into the corresponding directories by domain.

2. Walk the readers through the examples by providing step-by-step explanation similar to [this](examples/material/get_materials_by_formula.ipynb) example.

3. We use post-save hooks to automatically convert notebooks to python scripts. See [config](examples/config.py) file for more information. In order to facilitate code review, we exclude notebook sources in the `other/` directory from version control and store them in Git LFS [[3](#links)]. Please follow this convention.

4. Apply code formatting by installing development requirements as follows:

    ```bash
    pip install -e ."[dev]"
    pre-commit install
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

    Check more details about `pre-commit` [here](https://pre-commit.com/).

## Development

To run NBs locally with JupyterLite use `https://github.com/Exabyte-io/jupyterlite` repo to build and run the server.


For local API development with WebApp set the variables in the first cell of the notebooks as follows:

```python
API_HOST = "localhost"
API_PORT = "3000"
API_SECURE = "false"
API_VERSION = "2018-10-01"
```

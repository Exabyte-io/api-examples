    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Lite distribution contains pre-configured examples of materials transformations including simple ones like creation of supercell or a surface, and more complex like creating an interface with Zur and McGill Superlattice matching algorithm\n",

    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### [1. Interface creation with Zur and McGill Superlattice algorithm](create_interface_with_min_strain_zsl.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook lets user create an interface between two materials by finding matching superlattices and selecting optimal variants by size-strain trade-off. (Link to the lattice match algorithm: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.333084)\n",

    "### [2. Import of materials from JARVIS](import_material_from_jarvis_db_entry.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a workflow for processing materials data from the JARVIS database for use with Mat3ra.com platform."

    "In this notebook, we showcase a major advantage of APIs: interoperability. We begin by performing a query using the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org) API for all systems containing Iron and Oxygen. We then filter our results (for demonstraiton purposes, we keep only the first 10 materials found). Finally, we upload our results to the Mat3ra platform, where further calculations could be performed to characterize these materials."

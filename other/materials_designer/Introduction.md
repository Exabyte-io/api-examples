# Materials Transformations with Python Notebooks

## Overview

This Jupyter Lite distribution contains pre-configured examples of materials transformations including simple ones like creation of supercell or a surface, and more complex like creating an interface with Zur and McGill Superlattice matching algorithm

## Examples

### Zur and McGill Superlattice interface creation

[This file](zsl_interface_generation.ipynb) helps creating interface between two materials by finding matching superlattices and selecting optimal variants by size-strain trade off.
